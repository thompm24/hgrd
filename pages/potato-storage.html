<h1 id="potato-storage">Optimizing Potato Storage: Managing Risks, Enhancing Efficiency, and Maximizing Returns</h1>

			
			<p>Potato storage is a key element of modern-day potato production, looking to fulfil the demands of many markets. It can be practiced successfully but it must also be acknowledged that storage poses a risk. Its success depends on how well that risk is managed and, ultimately, whether the customer for the crop in question is delivered the quality for which they are prepared to pay. So, ensuring a store runs efficiently is a critical part of managing the potato production system. Inevitably, there are cost pressures on all components of the supply chain and, therefore, it is just as important to minimise operating costs in storage as it is to maximise returns from the enterprise.To this end, having good control of the store is crucial so that it only incurs cost when delivering a benefit.
			This control extends to such aspects as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Servicing and calibrating the store equipment before use</li>
				<li>Box stacking layout</li>
				<li>Loading the store correctly</li>
				<li>Operating the ventilation system and ensuring the airflow is optimised</li>
				<li>Minimising air leakage, and so on.</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Store management</h1>
			<p>Store management is a complex process and there are multiple points at which problems and inefficiencies can occur and jeopardise the prospect of success. It should be remembered that the crop in the store came from a field where there was opportunity to influence many attributes that affect how the crop performs in store, from simple decisions, including choice of variety, to more complex issues, such as the impact of chronological age on dormancy break and the need for sprout suppression. Another major factor in storage success is whether the crop has an adequately ‘set’ skin, as, without this, storage of potatoes is seldom straightforward.</p>


<h1 id="sprout">Sprout Supressant</h1>
			<h3>1,4 SIGHT</h3>
			<p>Dimethylnaphalene (DMN) given off by potatoes themselves naturally, was identified in Glasgow by Dr Harry Duncan, during the early 1980’s and was confirmed  as being an effective sprout suppressant in its own right.

			1,4 SIGHT® received Registration Approval for the use in Ireland, following on from Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Austria and Poland.

			1,4 SIGHT® was recognized and further developed commercially by 1,4Group and has been used veryeffectively as a treatment for controlling potato sprouts in a number of countries including the USA, Canada and New Zealand since 1995.

			1,4 SIGHT® is a dormancy enhancer (sprout suppressant) which prolongs dormancy in stored potatoes and is reversible. 1,4 SIGHT® can be used to reduce CIPC inputs or as a stand-alone product.  It is normally applied as a vapour (usually hot) to stored potatoes.

			1,4 SIGHT® can be used as a sole treatment for the long term processing material (9 degrees) at up to 6 times 20ppm **.  Application is made via an electro fogger machine which does not release any CO² emissions into the store.

			1,4 SIGHT® can also be used as a sparing chemical in conjunction with CIPC to help avoid exceedences.1,4 SIGHT® can be applied early or later but before chitting has taken place.

			1,4 SIGHT® penetrates through the potato skin and works internally to restore its dormancy.  Dormancy lowersthe respiration rate, slowing the loss of moisture and solids, thereby diminishing shrink and susceptibility to pressure bruise.  Restoring dormancy may also shorten the post-harvest “sweat period”.

			Sprout and chit control, pressure bruising and shrinkage are quality issues that store managers face each year.  Incorporating 1,4 SIGHT® into your storage treatment regime can provide unprecedented success in managing these common storage challenges.  Maintaining dormancy helps retain potato firmness resulting in fresher appearing skin finish and fewer load downgrades.

			** Actual rates depend on store variety, temperatures, venting and the condition of the potatoes.  Studies conducted at Sutton Bridge Experimental Unit, 1,4 SIGHT® demonstrated very good sprout control compared to CIPC.</p>

			<h3>Biox M</h3>

			Biox M is spearmint oil that has been approved for use on potatoes in store as a sprout suppressant. Efficacy of spearmint oil as a potato suppressant has been widely understood since the 1960s, but commercial development and trials leading to full approval has only been carried out in the last 15 years by Xeda SA in France. Biox-M recieved EU Annex 1 approval in september 2009, and has been granted full commercial approval in 8 EU member states and Israel. It was registered in Ireland in 2016.

			Mint Oil is a widely grown food product which, under controlled conditions, acts as a natural sprout inhibitor of stored potatoes. Biox M is extracted from the spearmint plant using a steam distillation process; no other products are added to the oil extracted.

			Used on its own or in conjunction with other post-harvest treatments, Biox M Offers growers an opportunity to minimize pesticides residues on stored potatoes. Biox M can be applied as a thermal fog or with Xedavap evaporator

			Fogging Machinery

			Biox-M is to be used exclusively with Xeda/Cedax Electrofog hot fogging equipment.

			Xedavap – Biox M has also recieved PRCD approval for use of the evaporative technology  “Xedavap”  for the application of Biox-M into store. This reduces the amount of product needed and also the cost of treatment. Xedavap gives small daily doses during the entire period of the potato storage.</p>

				<li>No residue risk</li>
				<li>Not persistent in buildings or boxes</li>
				<li>Approved for use on organic crops</li>
				<li>Safe for use in stores also used for seed</li>
				<li>No withholding period after treatment</li>
				<li>No MRL</li>
