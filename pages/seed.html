			<h2 id="germination">Germination Test</h2>
			<p>We also offer the grower the option to do a germination test in our laboratory or seed can be collected and sent to the Department of Agriculture labs in Celbridge. The object of the germination test is to the determine the maximum germination potential of a seed lot. This information can be used to compare the quality of different lots and also estimate the field planting value of a seed lot.
Laboratory tests aim to control the environment in order to give the most regular, rapid and complete germination for the majority of samples of a particular species. Germination of a seed in a laboratory test is defined as the emergence and development of the seedling to a stage where the aspect of its essential structures indicates whether or not it is able to develop further into a satisfactory plant under favourable conditions in the field.</p>
