	<h1>Potato Trials</h1>
	<p style="margin-right: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;font-size: 21px; color: #000000;">Over the years our growers have been facing new challenges on an ongoing basis with increasing costs of production, ever increasing restrictions on fertiliser use and ongoing loss of various chemistry used in the production of potatoes, the need for varieties with a low carbon footprint. This is particularly the case in the potato sector where it is getting more and more challenging every year. We made a decision that we needed to find new varieties that the perform well with these criteria in mind but also meet with Crisping Processors &amp; Fresh Chip needs and got them involved to ensure that the varieties we trailed were suitable for their requirements at the various stages in the storage and calendar year. So in 2021 we contacted most of the different potato breeders all across Europe looking for new potato varieties that may be suitable to Irish growing conditions, that would perform with reduced fertiliser inputs and that we could manage will the loss of various plant protection protects. Also most importantly supply processing specifications from off the field right through to July the following year out of store ensuring good cooking quality. In 2022 we planted 28 different crisping varieties in 4m x 50m plots, these were grown commercially under current farming restrictions. In August each year before harvesting we have open day where we invite all Irish potato growers to view the plots growing we had organised representatives from the various potato breeders to attend where they met and discussed various topics on their varieties from growing to harvesting and storage attributes. We harvest and put into a commercial Store.</p>
	<p style="margin-right: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 0px; color: #000000; font-size: 21px;"> At harvest we measured all the varieties yields and dry matters, tuber counts and sizes etc, noted any defects and measured their reducing sugars which is critical in processing. Defects and Sugars were checked each month from October until end of June the following year. We have concluded our results to these trials grown in 2022 in a report for the growers and the processing sector and will do the same again this year. We have continued the trial for 2023 with 27 crisp varieties but this time we have added Chipping Varieties. For Crisping we screened the varieties and selected which the ones we put in our trial for 2023 and added new ones on breeders recommendations and scrutiny of variety specifications. We have selected 20 Chip varieties as in previous trial we researched, on breeder recommendations and discussions with chipping industry. That would grow well under Irish conditions, store well and deliver the specifications and cooking quality that industry expects from off the field all the way through to end of June out of storage. With our trials programme we are endeavouring to support the Irish potato grower in this ever changing environment helping them grow sustainably and profitably into the future, the correct specifications and quality all year round that the processing industry expects. Up to now large amounts of the fresh chip industry has been supplied from the UK, lack of potato quality and reliability of supply are the reasons the industry give for this.</p>

	<h1>Potato Store Management<h1>
<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 2rem; color: #dddddd;">Potato storage is a key element of modern-day potato production, looking to fulfil the demands of many markets. It can be practiced successfully but it must also be acknowledged that storage poses a risk. Its success depends on how well that risk is managed and, ultimately, whether the customer for the crop in question is delivered the quality for which they are prepared to pay. So, ensuring a store runs efficiently is a critical part of managing the potato production system. Inevitably, there are cost pressures on all components of the supply chain and, therefore, it is just as important to minimise operating costs in storage as it is to maximise returns from the enterprise.To this end, having good control of the store is crucial so that it only incurs cost when delivering a benefit.<br>This control extends to such aspects as:</p>
<ul style="color: #dddddd; font-size: 2em">
	<li>Servicing and calibrating the store equipment before use</li>
	<li>Box stacking layout</li>
	<li>Loading the store correctly</li>
	<li>Operating the ventilation system and ensuring the airflow is optimised</li>
	<li>Minimising air leakage, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #dddddd; font-size: 2em;">Store management is a complex process and there are multiple points at which problems and inefficiencies can occur and jeopardise the prospect of success. It should be remembered that the crop in the store came from a field where there was opportunity to influence many attributes that affect how the crop performs in store, from simple decisions, including choice of variety, to more complex issues, such as the impact of chronological age on dormancy break and the need for sprout suppression. Another major factor in storage success is whether the crop has an adequately ‘set’ skin, as, without this, storage of potatoes is seldom straightforward.</p>
